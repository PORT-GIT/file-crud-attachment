Checking the availability of files through old word and access documents.

2. can show where the file is and who has it depending on the information fed into the system
3. can tell the user if a file already exists so that the same classification number is not used
4. can analyze word and access documents previously created to feed in data about the classification and movement of files into the system
5. easily allow a user to perform crud operations to avoid monotony
